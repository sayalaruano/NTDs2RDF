    [Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/neglected-tropical-diseases) are a heterogeneous group of 20 bacterial, viral, parasitic, 
    and fungal conditions that generally occur in developing tropical countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. NTDs mainly affect poor populations that do not have access to 
    safe water, sanitation, and high-quality healthcare. Because of the severe effects of NTDs (i.e., they can cause long-lasting disabilities), they reinforce the cycle of poverty 
    in vulnerable communities.

    Currently, there are several independent databases that contain information about proteins, metabolic pathways, and drugs involved in NTDs, but no integrated databases with all 
    the information. This unified resource could enable the systematic exploration of all the components of the NTDs, contributing to the research of potential therapies for these 
    diseases.
    
    The NTDs2RDF project aimed to create a schema and an RDF graph of proteins, metabolic pathways, drugs, and other relevant data for three NTDs (Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and 
    African trypanosomiasis) to integrate all the information in a single data structure that can be queried to obtain novel therapeutic insights.

I created this app for a project of a course about knowledge graphs from the [MSc in Systems Biology](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/systems-biology) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

    - Part of the code for this project was inspired by the [Medium blogpost](https://python.plainenglish.io/linked-data-a-framework-for-large-scale-database-integration-d20628021d4a) and 
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EdoWhite/ThemeParkAccidents_RDF-SPARQL) from [Edoardo Bianchi](https://medium.com/@edoardobianchi98) about this topic.
