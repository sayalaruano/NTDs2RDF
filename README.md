## **About the project**
[Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/neglected-tropical-diseases) are a heterogeneous group of 20 bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal conditions that generally occur in developing tropical countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. NTDs mainly affect poor populations that do not have access to safe water, sanitation, and high-quality healthcare. Because of the severe effects of NTDs (i.e., they can cause long-lasting disabilities), they reinforce the cycle of poverty  in vulnerable communities.

Currently, there are several independent databases that contain information about proteins, metabolic pathways, and drugs involved in NTDs, but no integrated databases with all the information. This unified resource could enable the systematic exploration of all the components of the NTDs, contributing to the research of potential therapies for these  diseases.

The **NTDs2RDF** project aimed to create a schema and an RDF graph of proteins, metabolic pathways, drugs, and other relevant data for three NTDs (Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and African trypanosomiasis) to integrate all the information in a single data structure that can be queried to obtain novel therapeutic insights.

## **How to run the web app locally?**
I used [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to create a Python virtual environment, which allows the management of python libraries and their dependencies. Each Pipenv virtual environment has a `Pipfile` with the names and versions of libraries installed in the virtual environment, and a `Pipfile.lock`, a JSON file that contains versions of libraries and their dependencies.

To create a Python virtual environment with libraries and dependencies required for this project, you should clone this GitHub repository, open a terminal, move to the folder containing this repository, and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install pipenv
$ pip install pipenv

# Create the Python virtual environment 
$ pipenv install

# Activate the Python virtual environment 
$ pipenv shell
```

You can find a detailed guide on how to use pipenv [here](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/).

Alternatively, you can create a conda virtual environment with the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

After installing the libraries, you can run the streamlit app locally with the command below:

```bash
$ streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```

## **Credits**
- Developed by [Sebasti√°n Ayala Ruano](https://sayalaruano.github.io/). I created this app for a project of a course about knowledge graphs from the [MSc in Systems Biology](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/systems-biology) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

- Part of the code for this project was inspired by the [Medium blogpost](https://python.plainenglish.io/linked-data-a-framework-for-large-scale-database-integration-d20628021d4a) and 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/EdoWhite/ThemeParkAccidents_RDF-SPARQL) from [Edoardo Bianchi](https://medium.com/@edoardobianchi98) about this topic.

## **Further details**
More details about the data collection, integration, and processing, as well as the creation of the knowledge graph and the web app are available in this [pdf report](requirements.txt).
