# NTDs2RDF
The NTDs2RDF project aimed to create a schema and an RDF graph of proteins, metabolic pathways, drugs, and other relevant data for three NTDs (Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and African trypanosomiasis) to integrate all the information in a single data structure that can be queried to obtain novel therapeutic insights.
